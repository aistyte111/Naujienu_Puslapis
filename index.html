    <h1>Crypto Reddit Mobilizes After Being Pummeled by Bankruptcies</h1>
    <p>A few months ago, Celsius Network LLC’s nearly 47,000-strong Reddit group was filled with talk about how much everyone was earning by
        lending their coins through the platform. After the company filed for bankruptcy, members began using the forum, among others, to fight
        for the return of their funds. Reddit, Telegram and Twitter helped drive the meme-stock craze, and now users on the sites are channeling
        that same energy into campaigning courtside on several crypto bankruptcy cases, including Celsius and Voyager Digital Ltd. They are tapping
        into the huge social media communities that already exist for both platforms, urging users to write letters to the judge overseeing Celsius’s case,
        pooling funds for legal representation as well as sharing news and advice.</p>
